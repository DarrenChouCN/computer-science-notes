### 10.1 The Project Sponsor

For over two decades, senior management has primarily served as project sponsors, typically coming from executive levels. The sponsor is responsible for maintaining communication between the contractor and the customer, ensuring the accurate flow of information and that the customer's funds are spent wisely. The sponsor typically relays cost and deliverable information, while the project manager provides updates on schedule and performance. Additionally, the sponsor guides objective setting, priority determination, project organization, planning, staffing, execution monitoring, and conflict resolution.

**Sponsor-Project Interface**

The role of the project sponsor evolves throughout the project life cycle. In the planning and initiation phases, the sponsor is actively involved, helping establish project objectives, providing insight into environmental factors, setting project priorities, and offering guidance on policies and procedures. The sponsor also acts as the key contact between the executive and client. During the execution phase, the sponsor takes a more passive role, offering support as needed and avoiding micromanagement. The sponsor’s involvement should be selective to avoid undermining the project manager’s authority. If conflicts arise between the project and line managers that cannot be resolved at the operational level, the sponsor may intervene to assist. The sponsor’s role is thus similar to that of a referee, ensuring that the project remains on track without overstepping into daily management.

**Table 10-1: The Project-Line Interface**

In immature organizations, project managers hold significant power over line managers and are responsible for negotiating resources, working directly with employees, and making decisions without input on performance evaluations. Leadership is centered on the project manager. In contrast, in mature organizations, authority is shared between project and line managers. The project manager works through line managers and makes recommendations to them, ensuring a more collaborative, team-centered approach to leadership.

**Table 10-2: The Executive Interface**

In immature organizations, executives are deeply involved in projects, act as project champions, and question the project manager’s decisions, often leading to shifting priorities and a lack of clear project sponsorship. There is little support for project management, and processes like project charters are poorly defined. In mature organizations, executives take a more passive role, act as project sponsors, and trust the project manager’s decisions. They offer continuous support, encourage problem-solving, and understand the importance of a project charter, reflecting a more structured and supportive approach to project management.

These tables highlight the contrast between immature and mature organizations in terms of how project managers and executives interact, with mature organizations showing a more balanced and supportive environment for project execution.

**Sponsor Function**

The role of a project sponsor is crucial for the entire project team, including line managers and employees. Sponsors should maintain open-door policies to ensure accessibility, but this can sometimes lead to issues such as an overload of trivial concerns or employees bypassing management layers. For critical or strategic projects, a senior manager, sometimes a steering committee member, is often assigned as the sponsor, while routine or noncritical projects may have a middle-management sponsor to encourage buy-in at that level.

Sponsorship is especially necessary for projects that require significant resources, involve multiple functional lines, or have the potential for conflicts or intense customer interaction. Customers often appreciate having a senior sponsor to oversee financial matters and ensure prudent spending. In competitive bidding scenarios, companies may include the resume of the executive sponsor in their proposals to offer a direct communication channel with top management, which can provide a competitive advantage.

A project sponsor's functions include participating in the sales effort, maintaining top-level client relationships, assisting the project manager with planning and staffing, handling major contractual matters, solving significant problems, and ensuring communication with company management. However, sponsorship can be time-consuming, and executives may struggle to effectively sponsor multiple projects simultaneously, leading to issues such as slow decision-making or unresolved policy matters.

As organizations mature, middle and lower-level management often take on the sponsor role, particularly when executives lack the time or the need for involvement in every project. Middle management’s proximity to the work and project personnel allows them to provide better advice and support, and ensures more effective decision-making. Ultimately, sponsorship falls to those best positioned to manage and oversee project activities efficiently.

**Today’s Project Sponsor**

The role of the project sponsor has evolved significantly from primarily interfacing with just the project manager, especially in small to medium-sized projects, to now engaging with the entire project team, particularly in complex projects. The sponsor's responsibilities today are broader and include maintaining close contact with the project team, preparing and endorsing the project charter, ensuring the project manager has the authority to make necessary decisions, and setting and communicating the project's priority.

The sponsor must also establish and reinforce both business and technical objectives, ensure realistic deadlines, explain the environmental and political factors affecting the project, and assist in designing the organizational structure. They are responsible for developing backup resource plans, creating project-specific policies, acting as the focal point for status updates for other executives, and defining expectations for the project manager and team. Additionally, the sponsor must provide mentorship to inexperienced project managers, offer constructive feedback, manage communications with the media, and encourage transparent reporting of both good and bad news without overreacting. The sponsor plays a key role in recognizing team pressures, managing paperwork costs, placating irate customers, and creating recognition systems, all while maintaining an open-door policy for the entire team, not just the project manager.

**Multiple Project Sponsors**

For projects with two life-cycle phases—planning and execution—the role of the project sponsor may vary depending on the project duration. For short-term projects (two years or less), it is advisable for the same individual to serve as the sponsor throughout the project. However, for longer projects (around five years), different sponsors may be assigned to each phase, ideally from the same level of management. While the sponsor does not need to come from the same line organization as the one performing the work, some companies may even require the sponsor to come from an organization with no vested interest in the project.

The project sponsor acts as an advisor or "big brother" to the project manager, offering guidance and solving problems that the project manager cannot resolve alone. However, the sponsor should never assume the role of the project manager, as their responsibilities are distinct and complementary.

**Invisible Sponsors**

In some industries, such as construction, the project sponsor is clearly identified in the proposal, making their role well-known. However, in certain situations, the sponsor may be "hidden," resulting in what is known as invisible or absentee sponsorship. This can occur in several ways: the sponsor may fear negative career impacts from poor decisions or project failure, lack understanding of sponsorship or project management, be overburdened and unable to engage meaningfully, or the project manager may fail to keep the sponsor informed.

To handle invisible sponsorship, some suggest that the project manager makes a decision and sends a memo to the sponsor, stating that unless they hear otherwise, the decision is assumed to be agreed upon. On the other hand, when a sponsor micromanages, the project manager may attempt to clarify roles and expectations to prevent overreach.

The most problematic type of sponsor is the "can't-say-no" sponsor, who continuously agrees with customer demands, leading to negative consequences for the contractor's organization. Effective sponsorship requires a sponsor who understands project management, whose goals align with the project's objectives, and who remains visible and well-informed about project status. This ensures that sponsorship is beneficial, providing valuable guidance without causing harm.

**Multinational Sponsors and Stakeholders**

Dealing with external stakeholders in global projects presents several challenges, primarily due to the complexity and unpredictability of the environment. Identifying stakeholders can be difficult, and global projects involve a significantly larger number of stakeholders compared to non-global projects. Additionally, the stakeholders in global projects are more likely to change over time, and there may be hidden stakeholders higher up in the organizational hierarchy. Many issues facing these stakeholders are not immediately identifiable, and solutions may need to be addressed at higher organizational levels.

Moreover, conflicts with global stakeholders often require different conflict resolution approaches than those used in non-global projects. Aaltonen and Sivonen propose five conflict resolution strategies for managing stakeholder pressure on global projects: adaptation (following stakeholder rules), compromising (negotiation and dialogue), avoidance (loosening attachments), dismissal (ignoring demands), and influence (proactively shaping stakeholder demands). It is essential to understand the operating and cultural context of the stakeholders, particularly in emerging markets, to effectively navigate the complexities of global project management.

It is essential to understand the operating and cultural context of the stakeholders, particularly in emerging markets, to effectively navigate the complexities of global project management.

**When to Seek Help**

The "traffic light" reporting system is used by project managers during status reporting to indicate the project's current state. It employs three colors to represent different levels of concern:

- Green light: Work is proceeding as planned, and sponsor involvement is not necessary.
- Yellow light: A potential problem exists, but no immediate action is required from the sponsor; they are informed for awareness.
- Red light: A significant problem has emerged that could affect time, cost, scope, or quality, requiring sponsor involvement to make timely decisions.

Yellow flags typically represent warnings that should be handled at middle management or lower levels. When a red flag is raised, the sponsor's active participation is needed to resolve critical issues impacting the project's constraints.

A key principle is that project sponsors and managers should not encourage employees to present problems without offering potential solutions or recommendations. A good corporate culture encourages early identification and resolution of problems, as quick action increases the chances of successful resolution. Some organizations may even use additional colors, such as an orange light for activities that extend past their target milestone date, providing further insight into project status.

**The New Role of the Executive**

As project management matures, executives are decentralizing project sponsorship to middle and lower management while adopting strategic roles. These include establishing Centers for Excellence, creating project management career paths, mentoring new project managers, and fostering a culture of benchmarking best practices. Executives also provide strategic business intelligence to support risk management, which is becoming a critical skill for project managers due to increasing pressure for schedule compression.

**Active versus Passive Involvement**

A key decision for executives is whether project sponsors should have a vested interest in the project or remain impartial. Impartial sponsors often function more as exit champions, ensuring objective oversight. This balance is crucial to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure effective project governance.

**Managing Scope Creep**

Scope creep, often driven by technically oriented team members striving to exceed specifications, can lead to significant cost overruns. Project managers must monitor and control scope changes, while executives must periodically review scope baselines with project managers to prevent unauthorized changes and ensure alignment with project goals.

**The Executive Champion**

Executive champions play a vital role in driving organizational change, such as implementing new project management methodologies. Their involvement signals executive-level support, accelerating the adoption and acceptance of these changes across the organization.

**The Failure of Project Governance**

Governance failures often stem from poor decision-making by executives, such as ignoring lessons learned, prioritizing political over project decisions, or failing to validate business cases. Excessive governance can lead to micromanagement, while inadequate oversight can result in scope changes or resource mismanagement. Effective governance requires a deep understanding of project management to ensure decisions align with both project and organizational objectives.

### 10.2 Handling Disagreements with the Sponsor

Disagreements between project managers and sponsors often arise due to insufficient technical knowledge, time constraints, or the assignment of impartial sponsors without vested interests. Project managers are expected to challenge assumptions and decisions, which can lead to conflicts requiring resolution by an executive steering committee. These committees are established to address severe disputes, such as disagreements over project cancellation, ensuring decisions align with organizational goals and risk tolerance.

### 10.3 The Collective Belief

Long-term projects often foster a collective belief—a fervent, sometimes irrational desire to achieve success that permeates the team, sponsors, and senior management. This belief can suppress dissent, ignore warning signs, and prioritize optimism over reality, making it difficult to recognize or admit failure. Characteristics of the collective belief include viewing failure as a personal or professional weakness, fearing exposure of mistakes, and selectively interpreting results to maintain the belief.

### 10.4 The Exit Champion

When collective belief overshadows rational decision-making, an exit champion is necessary to objectively assess the project’s viability and advocate for its termination if needed. Exit champions, often senior figures or board members, must be willing to risk their reputation to counteract the collective belief. They ensure that business plans include "exit ramps" for early termination and accelerate project closure to prevent unnecessary resource consumption. In some organizations, portfolio review board members serve as exit champions, providing oversight and making final decisions on project continuation or termination.

### 10.5 The In-House Representatives

On high-risk or high-priority projects, customers may assign in-house representatives to the contractor’s facility to ensure oversight and foster trust. These representatives, if managed effectively, act as additional project office resources without burdening the contractor’s budget. They can review draft reports, provide recommendations, and help align deliverables with customer expectations. While they are typically not placed in the contractor’s project office to maintain privacy, exceptions exist, such as during the design phase of construction projects, where quick decisions and approvals are critical. Most representatives understand their authority limits, though some may require escorts when interacting with functional teams or observing operations. In cases of disruptive behavior, removal of the representative may be necessary, often requiring strong support from the contractor’s project sponsor. Executives and sponsors must maintain proper oversight and communication with in-house representatives to ensure productive collaboration.

### 10.6 Stakeholder Relations Management

As projects grow in size and complexity, stakeholder relations management becomes critical, especially when the sponsor’s role expands to include a governance committee. Stakeholders—individuals, organizations, or entities affected by the project—can shift between passive and active roles, influencing decisions and outcomes. On smaller projects, project managers typically interact with a single sponsor, but larger projects involve numerous stakeholders, often geographically dispersed and varying in authority, management levels, and cultural backgrounds. Managing these relationships is time-consuming and challenging, particularly when stakeholders transition from observers to active participants, requiring careful coordination to align interests and ensure project success.

**COMMITMENTS**

Effective stakeholder relations management relies on securing commitments from all stakeholders, which can be difficult if their perceived value or interests differ. Stakeholders may view the project’s value in terms of prestige, employment, deliverables, or future opportunities. Aligning these diverse expectations is complex, as stakeholders may prioritize personal or organizational goals over the project’s objectives. Additionally, external factors like politics, economic conditions, or cultural differences can hinder collaboration, making it essential to establish clear agreements early in the project.

**EXPECTATIONS FOR THE STAKEHOLDER**

Not all stakeholders understand their roles or how to interact effectively with the project manager. Some may act as passive observers, while others may micromanage, undermining the project manager’s authority. To address this, project managers should clarify stakeholder roles and expectations early, similar to how team roles are defined during project kickoff meetings. This ensures stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the project’s objectives, reducing the risk of misalignment or conflict.

**SOLUTION PROVIDERS**

Modern stakeholder relations management emphasizes engagement and long-term partnerships, with project managers acting as solution providers rather than mere service deliverers. This approach focuses on delivering business solutions and fostering strategic partnerships, benefiting both the client and the provider. Solution providers bring expertise in managing complexity, cultural adaptability, and virtual teams, aligning stakeholder expectations with long-term value rather than short-term profitability.

**STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION**

Identifying stakeholders is a critical first step, especially on multinational projects with diverse stakeholders at various management levels. Stakeholders can be grouped by financial or resource contributions, decision-making authority, or other factors. However, not all stakeholders have the same expectations; some may prioritize project success, while others may have hidden agendas or prefer failure. Understanding these dynamics is essential for effective stakeholder management.

**STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS**

On large, complex projects, project managers must prioritize influential stakeholders who can provide significant support or have the power to impact the project’s success. Key questions include identifying who has decision-making authority, who requires direct involvement, and who can influence project outcomes. Stakeholder influence and importance can change over the project’s lifecycle, requiring continuous reassessment and adaptation.

**STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT**

Engaging stakeholders involves understanding their needs, expectations, and concerns while building trust and support. This process helps identify supporters, advocates, and opponents, enabling the project manager to address potential issues early. Effective engagement also involves tailoring communication and performance reports to meet each stakeholder’s specific interests, even if it requires maintaining multiple reporting flows.

**INFORMATION FLOW**

Clear and consistent communication is essential for stakeholder relations management. Project managers must determine what information stakeholders need, when they need it, and in what format. While some stakeholders may require frequent updates, others may prefer less detailed reports. Effective communication builds trust, anticipates stakeholder actions, and prevents supporters from becoming blockers.

**CHALLENGES AND FAILURES**

Despite best efforts, stakeholder relations management can fail due to inviting stakeholders too early or too late, involving the wrong stakeholders, or allowing key stakeholders to become disinterested or impatient. Unethical leadership or communication can also damage stakeholder relationships. Successful stakeholder management requires balancing diverse interests, maintaining clear communication, and fostering trust to achieve project objectives and long-term partnerships.

### 10.7 Project Portfolio Management

Project portfolio management addresses the risks of suboptimized decision-making by ensuring that projects align with strategic business objectives rather than focusing solely on individual project interests. Common challenges include intense competition for resources, lack of prioritization, misalignment with business strategies, and an inability to recognize project value. To mitigate these issues, companies centralize the management of strategic projects through portfolio governance committees. These committees prioritize projects, optimize resource allocation, and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

On a macro level, portfolio governance committees answer critical questions such as whether the right projects are being pursued, whether they are executed effectively, and whether the portfolio sufficiently supports strategic objectives. On a micro level, they monitor project value, manage risks, intervene when necessary, and decide when to terminate underperforming projects. They also assess resource optimization, project prioritization, and alignment with strategic goals.

To make informed decisions, governance committees rely on a broader set of metrics beyond traditional time, cost, and scope measures. Modern project managers report business-oriented metrics, reflecting their evolving role as business-savvy leaders. Portfolio management ensures that projects contribute to long-term value and strategic success, balancing competing constraints and maximizing the overall portfolio’s impact.

### 10.8 Politics

Politics are an inevitable aspect of project management, often catching inexperienced project managers off guard. Decisions driven by personal interests, disagreements among stakeholders, resource negotiations, and conflicting priorities can all fuel political dynamics. While politics can sometimes lead to positive outcomes—such as securing necessary resources or higher project priority—they often result in unfavorable consequences when individuals seek power, control, or personal advancement.

Bad politics, characterized by disruptive or dysfunctional behavior, can harm team morale and create win-lose scenarios during conflicts. Project sponsors play a crucial role in mitigating external political influences, but they have limited ability to shield the team entirely. Recognizing and managing political dynamics is essential for maintaining project focus and fostering a collaborative environment. Effective navigation of politics requires balancing stakeholder interests and leveraging positive political influence to achieve project goals.
