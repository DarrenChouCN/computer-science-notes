### 9.1 Predicting Project Success 

Predicting project success is complex, and many managers focus only on time, cost, and performance parameters. While this can highlight immediate issues, it does not provide a complete picture of whether the project has been properly managed. In organizations where survival depends on a steady stream of successfully completed projects, a project manager may force a project to success in the short term, but over time, such control can lead to burnout or avoidance by team members. Project success relies on the collective effort of the project manager and team, the parent organization, and the client organization. The project manager should select the right team members, set realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals, maintain good relationships with the client, and have backup plans. The parent organization must provide sufficient support and resources, delegate authority to a capable project manager, and ensure smooth communication. The client organization should minimize interference with the project team, respond promptly to requests for information, and ensure proper resource allocation.

Additionally, the success of the project depends on the support of both the parent and client organizations. The parent organization must be adaptable to change, have effective strategic planning, and commit to supporting the project. The client organization needs to set clear goals, streamline approval processes, and ensure that resources and authority are in place. These supportive variables lay a foundation for success, but success ultimately depends on the actions taken by all parties involved. Managers must approach projects holistically, plan, control, and facilitate communication, and remain flexible to make necessary adjustments during project execution.
