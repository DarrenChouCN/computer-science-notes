### 9.1 Predicting Project Success

Predicting project success is complex, and many managers focus only on time, cost, and performance parameters. While this can highlight immediate issues, it does not provide a complete picture of whether the project has been properly managed. In organizations where survival depends on a steady stream of successfully completed projects, a project manager may force a project to success in the short term, but over time, such control can lead to burnout or avoidance by team members. Project success relies on the collective effort of the project manager and team, the parent organization, and the client organization. The project manager should select the right team members, set realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals, maintain good relationships with the client, and have backup plans. The parent organization must provide sufficient support and resources, delegate authority to a capable project manager, and ensure smooth communication. The client organization should minimize interference with the project team, respond promptly to requests for information, and ensure proper resource allocation.

Additionally, the success of the project depends on the support of both the parent and client organizations. The parent organization must be adaptable to change, have effective strategic planning, and commit to supporting the project. The client organization needs to set clear goals, streamline approval processes, and ensure that resources and authority are in place. These supportive variables lay a foundation for success, but success ultimately depends on the actions taken by all parties involved. Managers must approach projects holistically, plan, control, and facilitate communication, and remain flexible to make necessary adjustments during project execution.

### 9.2 Project Management Effectiveness

Project managers must establish strong working relationships with upper-level management, as their success and career progression often depend on these interactions. Four key variables measure the effectiveness of these relationships: credibility, priority, accessibility, and visibility.

**Credibility:**

- Built through sound decision-making and diverse experience.
- Enhanced by project success and visible achievements.
- Emphasize facts over opinions and give credit to others to strengthen believability.

**Priority:**

- Highlight the project’s alignment with organizational goals.
- Stress competitive advantages, potential spin-offs, and testimonial support from stakeholders.
- Anticipate and address priority conflicts proactively.

**Accessibility:**

- Ensure direct communication with top management.
- Present proposals that benefit the entire organization, not just the project.
- Deliver logical, polished presentations and build personal rapport with decision-makers.

**Visibility:**

- Manage the level of visibility needed for the project.
- Make a strong impact during presentations and adopt contrasting management styles when appropriate.
- Leverage team members and timely informational meetings to maintain visibility.

By effectively managing these variables, project managers can enhance their influence, secure support, and ensure project success while advancing their careers.

### 9.3 Expectations

In project management, expectations are bidirectional and multifaceted, involving project managers, team members, and upper-level management. Each party has distinct expectations of the others, which are critical for project success. Upper-level management expects project managers to assume full accountability for project outcomes, provide effective reporting and recommendations (not just alternatives), minimize organizational disruption, handle interpersonal issues independently, and demonstrate initiative, growth, and self-starting capabilities. These expectations differentiate project managers from line managers, who are typically accountable only for their specific functional areas and may not need to manage cross-organizational impacts or decision-making at the same level.

Project managers, in turn, have their own expectations of upper-level management. They seek clearly defined decision channels, timely action on requests, sufficient resources, and support in interfacing with other departments. They also expect assistance in conflict resolution, strategic guidance, feedback, and protection from political infighting. Additionally, project managers look for opportunities for personal and professional growth, as well as clear communication of expectations to ensure alignment and effective execution.

Team members also have specific expectations of their project managers. They rely on the project manager to provide leadership, direction, and a relaxed work environment. They expect the manager to foster innovation, reduce conflicts, and defend the team against external pressures. Team members also want their project manager to act as a spokesperson and representative to higher management, facilitate team integration, and resist unnecessary changes that could disrupt workflow. On the other hand, project managers expect their teams to demonstrate self-development, commitment, and results-oriented behavior. They look for effective communication, conflict resolution skills, and adaptability to change, along with high morale and seamless interfacing within the team.

Beyond these expectations, team members have fundamental needs that project managers must recognize and address. These include a sense of belonging, job security, and opportunities for career growth. Team members also need respect for their work, protection from organizational politics, and a genuine interest in the tasks they are assigned. While these needs may not always be explicitly stated, they are essential for maintaining motivation and productivity.

Understanding and addressing these expectations and needs is crucial for fostering collaboration, productivity, and project success. Project managers must balance these dynamics while ensuring alignment with organizational goals, creating an environment where all parties can thrive and contribute effectively to the project’s objectives.

### 9.4 Lessons Learned

Documenting lessons learned is critical for continuous improvement, even from failed projects, but many companies struggle with this due to employee reluctance to admit mistakes, leading to repeated errors. To address this, organizations are increasingly emphasizing structured approaches, such as maintaining project diaries, holding post-implementation meetings, and creating case studies that document successes and failures. These case studies are often used for training future project managers. Some companies require project managers to keep detailed project notebooks and files, though this can be impractical for large projects. A common approach is to conduct post-implementation meetings at key milestones, such as after the first production run and again six months later to assess customer feedback, as customer reactions can reveal unexpected flaws in decisions. This iterative process ensures that lessons are captured and applied to future projects, fostering organizational learning and growth.

### 9.5 Understanding Best Practices

Understanding and capturing best practices is essential for achieving sustained competitive advantage in project management. Best practices are actions or activities that consistently deliver superior results, often leading to measurable efficiency, effectiveness, and value for both the company and its customers. While definitions vary, best practices generally represent proven methods that work well repetitively and can differentiate an organization from its competitors. Historically, best practices were learned from successes in private industry and from failures in government projects, but over time, both sectors began to recognize the importance of learning from successes, leading to the emergence of practices such as life-cycle phases, standardization, integrated project teams, and earned-value measurement.

Identifying and validating best practices requires addressing critical questions, such as who determines what qualifies as a best practice, how to evaluate its validity, and how to gain executive support. Organizations often use committees or Project Management Offices (PMOs) to assess potential best practices, employing templates with criteria like measurability, transferability, longevity, and impact on competitive differentiation. Best practices differ from lessons learned, as they focus on favorable outcomes rather than both positive and negative experiences.

To ensure adoption, best practices must be recognized as intellectual property that benefits the entire organization. Quantifiable best practices are more likely to gain executive buy-in, as they demonstrate clear value. Additionally, some organizations include unique criteria in their evaluation templates, such as the ability to avoid failure or resolve critical situations during crises. By systematically capturing, validating, and championing best practices, organizations can enhance project management effectiveness and drive long-term success.

**Best Practices versus Proven Practices**

The term "best practices" has been widely used to describe techniques, processes, or methods that deliver superior outcomes with fewer complications, often becoming standard procedures once proven effective. However, the term is increasingly scrutinized, as it may imply past inefficiencies or suggest there is only one correct way to achieve a task, which is often not the case. A more accurate term might be "proven practices," reflecting methods that have been validated through repeated success and integration into standard operations. While "best practices" remains commonly used, it is important to recognize that other terms may better capture the concept of reliable, effective, and adaptable approaches to achieving results.

**Levels of Best Practices**

Best practices can emerge both within and outside an organization, varying in complexity and specificity across different levels. At the broadest level, professional standards, such as those defined by PMI, provide general guidelines with low complexity. Industry standards refine these practices to align with specific sectors, while company-specific best practices tailor them to organizational needs. Further refinement occurs at the project level, where best practices address particular products or services. At the most specific level, individual best practices consider personal risk tolerance and role interactions. In strategic planning, broader best practices aid strategy formulation, while more specific ones facilitate execution.

**Common Beliefs**

Several common beliefs about best practices highlight their complexity and potential challenges. Best practices are often interrelated, with the discovery of one leading to another, particularly within the same category. Due to their dependencies, categorizing best practices can be more effective than identifying them individually. However, best practices may not always be transferable, as what succeeds in one company may fail in another. While some best practices may appear simplistic, their consistent application fosters excellence and customer satisfaction. Additionally, financial health does not determine a company's ability to implement best practices. Despite good intentions, poor expectations, misjudgment, or improper implementation can lead to detrimental outcomes.

**Best Practices Library**

Best practices are part of project management knowledge, but not all best practices apply to every company. There may be interconnections between best practices, where discovering one can lead to the identification of more related practices. However, the implementation of best practices may fail due to insufficient understanding, poor execution, or lack of rigor. While some best practices may seem simple, their consistent application can enhance business performance and customer satisfaction.

Figure 9-3 illustrates different levels of best practices, ranging from industry standards, company-specific practices, project-specific practices, to individual best practices. Complexity increases as the level rises, while the quantity decreases.

Figure 9-4 outlines the process of creating a best practices library, which consists of four stages: discovery and understanding, evaluation, classification, and storage. Knowledge transfer can be facilitated through intranets, seminars, and case studies.

Figure 9-5 presents a classification framework for a best practices library, covering various aspects such as project management, technological advancements, continuous improvement, customer interaction methods, and company-wide business performance improvements. This ensures that businesses can efficiently store and retrieve best practices to enhance efficiency and overall business outcomes.
