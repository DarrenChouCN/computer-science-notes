### 3.0 Introduction 

**Overview:**
Over the past 50 years, management has realized that organizations must be dynamic and able to restructure quickly in response to external factors such as market competition and technological changes. Organizational change often arises from internal issues like underutilization of talent or a lack of cooperation. Change involves adjustments to both technical systems (technology and machinery) and social systems (people and group behavior), requiring a balance between the two.

**Challenges of Organizational Restructuring:**
Organizational restructuring often leads to conflicts, especially when altering roles, spans of control, or decision-making structures. The goal is to find a compromise between classical management principles and behavioral theories, addressing both individual and organizational needs. The structure must be adapted to the specific needs of the company, and selecting the right organizational form depends on the judgment of management.

### 3.1 Organizational Work Flow 

Organizations are constantly restructured to adapt to environmental demands, and such restructuring can affect both formal and informal roles within the organization. Behaviorists play a key role in helping the informal organization adapt to changes and resolve conflicts, though their effectiveness depends on their involvement in the formal organization as well. Regardless of the chosen organizational structure, formal channels must be established to ensure each individual has a clear understanding of their authority, responsibility, and accountability.

**Definitions:**

- Authority: The power granted to individuals, often through their position, allowing them to make final decisions.
- Responsibility: The obligation individuals have to perform their assigned tasks effectively within the formal organization.
- Accountability: Being answerable for the completion of specific tasks. (Accountability = authority + responsibility)

While authority and responsibility can be delegated to lower levels, accountability generally remains with the individual. However, many executives resist delegation, believing accountability can exist solely through responsibility. Establishing good relationships between project and functional managers is often challenging, especially when transitioning from a traditional to a project-based organizational structure. Trust is essential for success in this process.

### 3.2 Traditional (Classical) Organization 

The traditional management structure, which has been in place for over two centuries, was effective in simpler times when companies had fewer product lines. It allowed for control and minimal conflict, but as organizations grew and diversified, and as technology became more integrated, these traditional forms began to face challenges. Companies could no longer survive with only one or two product lines, and the traditional structure failed to adequately integrate activities and address emerging conflicts. This led to a search for new organizational forms.

**Advantages of the Traditional Organization:**
- Easier budgeting and cost control.
- Strong technical control and expertise in specialized functional areas.
- Good communication channels and well-defined authority and responsibility.
- Flexibility in manpower usage and continuity in functional disciplines.
- Suitable for mass production activities and effective personnel control.

**Disadvantages of the Traditional Organization:**
- No one individual is responsible for the total project, which can lead to a lack of accountability.
- Coordination becomes complex, slowing decision-making and often favoring stronger functional groups.
- Response to customer needs is slow due to a lack of a customer focal point.
- Motivation and innovation are often diminished due to the focus on functional tasks over project goals.
- Difficulty in pinpointing responsibility, and lack of direct project reporting and authority.

In essence, while the traditional structure has clear advantages in areas like cost control and technical specialization, it struggles with integrating cross-functional activities, making decisions quickly, and addressing customer needs in a timely manner. These challenges were increasingly apparent as project management began to gain prominence in the 1960s.

### 3.3 Pure Product (Projectized) Organization 

The pure product (or projectized) organizational structure, as shown in the figure, develops as a division within a division. In this structure, the program manager has complete authority over the entire project, including assigning tasks, conducting merit reviews, and managing all conflicts within the organization. This creates strong communication channels and quick reaction times as individuals report to only one person. Projects can be completed more efficiently, with trade-off studies done rapidly without worrying about other projects, as long as shared resources are not required. Functional managers maintain qualified staffs for new product development without sharing personnel across different projects.

**Advantages of the Pure Project Structure:**
- Complete line authority over the project, allowing strong control.
- Rapid reaction times and strong communication.
- Each project has a dedicated staff, improving project focus.
- Ability to focus on product development without external interruptions.
- Interface management is easier, and upper management can focus on executive decisions.

**Disadvantages of the Pure Project Structure:**
- High cost of maintaining the structure due to duplication of effort, facilities, and personnel.
- Personnel may remain on projects longer than necessary, causing inefficiencies.
- Technology suffers because of a lack of strong functional groups for technical interchange.
- Difficult to manage shared resources, which may lead to conflicts between projects over equipment and facilities.
- Lack of career continuity for project personnel as they may not have a permanent position after project completion.
- Personnel motivation may be a challenge due to the lack of long-term career opportunities.

As with the traditional structure, the pure project structure has clear advantages in terms of control and focus on specific projects, but it also brings significant challenges related to cost, resource sharing, and personnel management.

### 3.4 Matrix Organizational Form 

The matrix organizational form seeks to combine the advantages of both functional and product-based structures, making it ideal for project-driven companies. In a matrix structure, each project manager reports directly to the vice president and general manager. The project manager has complete responsibility and authority for the project, while functional departments maintain technical excellence. Department managers ensure the sharing of technical knowledge and industry advancements across projects.

In matrix organizations, project management is a collaborative function. Information sharing is mandatory, and multiple team members may work on the same task. However, project and functional managers must continuously negotiate, as both have authority, responsibility, and accountability on each project.

**Key principles for matrix development:**
- Participants are full-time on projects to ensure loyalty.
- Horizontal and vertical channels must exist for making commitments.
- Quick conflict resolution mechanisms are needed.
- Effective communication channels between managers are essential.
- Managers must negotiate for resources.

The matrix approach aims to create synergy between project and functional management, though its success depends on the mutual understanding and cooperation between managers. Challenges arise when defining project priorities, responsibilities, and how functional units interact with project goals.

**Advantages of Matrix Structure:**
- Maximum control over project resources, cost, and personnel.
- Rapid response to changes and conflict resolution.
- Clear career paths for project personnel after project completion.
- Better sharing of expertise across projects.
- Minimal conflicts and effective balance between time, cost, and performance.

**Disadvantages of Matrix Structure:**
- Multidimensional information and workflow can be complex.
- Dual reporting creates potential for confusion and inefficiency.
- Constant shifts in priorities may lead to role ambiguity.
- Potential for continuous conflict requiring resolution.
- Increased overhead costs due to duplicated roles and administrative positions.

With proper planning, training, and role definitions, the matrix structure can overcome many of its disadvantages. However, it requires careful management to avoid excessive executive-level positions and overhead costs.

### 3.5 Modification of Matrix Structures 

The matrix organizational structure combines the advantages of functional and project-based structures, making it ideal for project-driven organizations. It emphasizes collaboration, with project and functional managers sharing authority and responsibility.

**Forms of Matrix Structures**

**Small Companies:**
All project managers report directly to the general manager, who resolves conflicts across projects. This works for companies with few projects and manageable coordination needs.

**Medium to Large Companies:**
A Director of Project Management (or equivalent) is introduced to oversee all project activities, reducing the burden on the general manager. Functional managers (e.g., engineering, operations) retain technical oversight while project managers focus on individual project goals.

**Philosophy of Management (Figure 3-5):**
- Project Managers: Rely on human skills (e.g., leadership, communication) for team coordination and goal management.
- Project Engineers: Focus on technical expertise, ensuring engineering and technical aspects align with project requirements.
- Organizations may merge these roles for efficiency, though project engineers often report to the engineering department to maintain authority over technical decisions.

**Roles: Project Management vs. Project Engineering (Table 3-5):**
While both roles share responsibilities such as project planning, cost control, schedule management, and system specifications, their focus differs:
- Project Managers: Handle contract control, reporting, procurement, staffing, and management systems to ensure overall project success.
- Project Engineers: Focus on configuration control, testing, production, and providing technical leadership for project execution.

**Key Features and Challenges:**
- Advantages: Strong control over resources, efficient use of personnel, rapid response to changes, career continuity for employees, and a balance of time, cost, and performance.
- Disadvantages: Complexity from dual reporting, shifting priorities, potential for conflicts, higher administrative costs, and role ambiguity.

The matrix structure provides flexibility and balance but requires proper planning, training, and role definition to address its challenges effectively.

### 3.6 The Strong, Weak, or Balanced Matrix 

Matrix structures are classified as strong, weak, or balanced based on the influence of the project manager versus the line managers:

**Strong Matrix:**
- The project manager has greater authority, including technical decision-making, and workers seek their guidance first.
- Typically, project managers are internally promoted and recognized as technical experts.

**Weak Matrix:**
- The line managers hold more authority, and workers prioritize their input.
- Project managers are often externally hired but must have sufficient industry knowledge.

**Balanced Matrix:**
- Authority is shared equally, requiring collaboration between project and line managers.

The matrix's strength depends on whether the project manager or line managers control technical direction. Strong matrices rely on project managers with technical expertise and organizational credibility.

### 3.7 Project Management Offices (PMOs)
PMOs have become essential in both project-driven and non-project-driven organizations, although their implementation is often met with resistance in the latter due to concerns about power, authority, and organizational change. The role of PMOs has evolved over time, from informal committees to integral components of corporate strategy.

**Key Functions of PMOs**

**Project Management Methodology Development:**
- Develop and update flexible methodologies, frameworks, and templates for project management.
- Recommend and implement improvements to existing methodologies.

**Training and Support:**
- Facilitate project management training and knowledge transfer through coaching and mentorship.
- Provide planning, scheduling, and control support to project managers.

**Standardization and Benchmarking:**
- Ensure standardization in estimating, planning, scheduling, controlling, and reporting.
- Identify and implement project standards and best practices.
- Conduct audits of methodologies and practices.

**Knowledge Management:**
- Archive and disseminate lessons learned.
- Maintain project databases, intranets, and information systems for project management intellectual property.

**Strategic Planning:**
- Support corporate strategic planning by aligning project management activities with organizational goals.
- Perform risk assessments, disaster recovery planning, and portfolio management activities.

**Evolving Role of the PMO**
- Past Role: Supported individual projects and project managers.
- Current Role: Acts as a corporate center for managing project management intellectual property, aligning it with organizational strategic planning. PMOs now serve the entire organization rather than focusing on specific customers.

**Strategic Importance of PMOs**

PMOs enhance profitability and organizational efficiency by maintaining and leveraging project management intellectual property. To maximize their benefits, PMOs must:
- Capture and disseminate project data effectively.
- Provide tools like intranets, websites, and databases to share knowledge with stakeholders.
- Engage in strategic planning to ensure alignment with corporate objectives.

### 3.8 Selecting the Organizational Form 

The selection of an organizational structure for project management depends on the complexity, uniqueness, and strategic importance of the projects being undertaken. Organizations must balance the demands of effective project control with the overall company structure, resources, and goals.

**Key Factors Influencing Organizational Form**

**Project Characteristics:**
- Clearly defined goals.
- Unique, infrequent, or unfamiliar tasks for the organization.
- Complex interdependencies of tasks.
- Critical importance to the company.

**Basic Influencing Factors:**
- Project size and duration.
- Costs and available resources.
- Top management philosophy and visibility.
- Organizational experience with project management.
- Project location and unique aspects (e.g., labor- vs. capital-intensive projects).

**Additional Factors (Galbraith, 1971):**
- Diversity and rate of change of product lines.
- Interdependencies between functional units.
- Level of technology involved.
- Economies of scale and organizational size.

**Fundamental Parameters for Implementation**
- Integrating Devices: Mechanisms to coordinate efforts across departments.
- Authority Structure: The degree of authority delegated (functional, product, or matrix management).
- Influence Distribution: Participation in planning, resource allocation, and approvals.
- Information Systems: Tools to ensure efficient communication and decision-making.

**Challenges and Considerations**

**Integration Across Functional Boundaries:**
- Informal integration may work for small, low-conflict projects, while formal integration (e.g., matrix structure) is needed for larger, high-conflict environments.

**Size and Resources:**
Smaller companies may struggle to maintain specialist teams, leading to higher costs for lost economies of scale.

**Dynamic State of Equilibrium:**
- Project organizations require flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.
- Implementing a project structure often creates new management roles and upgrades existing jobs, requiring careful planning.

**Overlapping Structures:**
Project management rarely exists independently of traditional organizational structures. Companies often have multiple organizational forms (e.g., a matrix for R&D and a product structure for other operations) depending on the project's nature and function.

### 3.9 Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Project Management 

Strategic Business Units (SBUs) are organizational structures designed to focus on specific customer or business needs. Each SBU groups functional units under a single entity responsible for profit or loss and aligns closely with a particular segment of the business.

**Structure and Benefits (Figure 3-6)**

**Example:** In the automotive industry, SBUs may be structured to serve individual customers such as Ford, Chrysler, or GM.

**Key Features:**
- Each SBU is autonomous and has its own project and program managers.
- The executive in charge acts as the sponsor for all project and program activities within the SBU.
- The customer-focused structure enables closer alignment with customer requirements.

**Shared Resources:** Some resources, such as manufacturing plants or corporate services (e.g., HR, training, cost accounting), may be shared across SBUs.

**Multidimensional Platform Management (Figure 3-7)**

A more complex structure involves integrating platform management into the SBU model.
- Platform Managers: Responsible for the design and enhancement of shared components (e.g., powertrain, chassis).
- SBU Program Managers: Customize platforms to fit the specific needs of new products, such as different car models.

**Key Features:**
- This matrix structure is multidimensional: Each SBU can have its own internal matrix, while the platform management layer spans across SBUs.
- Multinational Scope: Manufacturing plants supporting this structure may operate globally, adding complexity to resource coordination and management.

**Advantages of SBU Project Management**
- Customer Focus: Enhanced ability to tailor services and products to specific customer needs.
- Resource Sharing: Efficient use of corporate and manufacturing resources across multiple SBUs.
- Specialization: Platform management ensures technical expertise and consistency across shared components while allowing SBUs to innovate at the product level.

**Challenges of SBU with Platform Management**
- Complexity: Multidimensional matrices require careful coordination between SBUs, platform managers, and shared resources.
- Global Operations: Managing multinational plants and diverse markets increases logistical and organizational challenges.
- Conflict Resolution: Potential for conflicts between SBUs and platform managers regarding resource allocation and design priorities.

### 3.10 Transitional Management 

Transitioning to a project-driven or matrix organization requires effective transitional management, which focuses on managing the conversion period. Success depends on proper planning, training, and employee involvement while addressing challenges systematically.

**Key Challenges and Solutions**

**Authority and Power Transition:**
- Challenges: Line managers may resist losing control, and project managers may struggle with authority over shared resources.
- Solutions: Build trust between project and line managers, encourage collaboration, and train all parties to understand their roles.

**Employee and Organizational Adaptation:**
- Challenges: Resistance to new roles (e.g., project manager acceptance), personnel issues from relocation or status changes, and uncertainty about management styles (Theory X vs. Theory Y).
- Solutions: Train employees and managers on project management methodologies, foster teamwork through planning, and support employees during status or role adjustments.

**Policies, Processes, and Tools:**
- Challenges: Establishing new policies and procedures, creating standard reporting structures, and managing contradicting demands.
- Solutions: Gradually implement flexible policies, standardize project reporting, and integrate tools across functional and project groups to align practices.

**Communication and Collaboration:**
- Challenges: Building new communication channels while maintaining existing ones and managing unhealthy competition.
- Solutions: Promote multidirectional communication, reduce excessive competition, and use planning groups to strengthen collaboration.

**Cost and Resource Management:**
- Challenges: Overmanagement or undermanagement of resources, shifting priorities, and addressing increased conflict during transition.
- Solutions: Balance resource allocation, establish clear priorities, and maintain executive support to manage conflicts constructively.

**Critical Success Factors**

**Planning and Execution:**
- Plan the transition on a life-cycle basis to ensure smooth implementation.
- Focus on systematic and flexible strategies to avoid unnecessary rigidity.

**Training and Employee Involvement:**
- Provide comprehensive training to executives, managers, and employees in project management skills.
- Involve employees in decision-making to secure their buy-in and commitment.

**Executive Commitment and Leadership:**
- Senior executives must demonstrate visible support and maintain commitments throughout the transition.
- Avoid schedule or performance compromises; prioritize achieving project objectives over cost savings.

**Key Takeaways**
- Transition periods are unpredictable and vary in duration.
- Trust-building, communication, and flexibility are essential for success.
- Properly managing authority, resources, and organizational behavior ensures smoother adaptation.

### 3.11 Seven Fallacies that Delay Project Management Maturity

- Fallacy 1: "The goal is to implement project management."
The true objective is developing processes and systems that consistently deliver successful projects with minimal disruption.

- Fallacy 2: "Maturity requires numerous forms, templates, and checklists."
Maturity is achieved through time-based levels and broad adoption of streamlined methodologies, not by maximizing documentation.

- Fallacy 3: "Project management software accelerates maturity."
Software should be selected based on its ability to enhance efficiency and reduce costs, not its features or price.

- Fallacy 4: "Small projects are the best for initial implementation."
Large projects demonstrate the scalability of processes, whereas small projects risk skepticism regarding project management’s effectiveness.

- Fallacy 5: "Broadcast project results to demonstrate success."
Emphasize how project management contributed to success, ensuring the methodology’s value is recognized organization-wide.

- Fallacy 6: "Executive support is sufficient."
Visible, active executive involvement is required to demonstrate genuine commitment and ensure organizational buy-in.

- Fallacy 7: "Training employees to become PMPs ensures maturity."
Project management maturity demands continuous education beyond certifications, fostering lifelong learning and system-wide development.
These misconceptions hinder progress and delay maturity. A well-planned, organization-wide approach with active support can overcome these barriers effectively.
