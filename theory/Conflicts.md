### 7.1 The Conflict Environment 

Conflicts are inevitable in project environments due to differing values, interests, feelings, and goals among team members. Effective conflict resolution is crucial for project success, as unresolved conflicts can lead to project failure. The time required to resolve conflicts varies, with fewer people typically leading to quicker resolutions. Conflicts with direct reports are easier to resolve than those involving team members administratively tied to other functional managers.

Several common causes of conflicts in projects include:
- Imposed Constraints: Project managers often join after the business case is prepared, leading to constraints that may not align with the project plan, making timely delivery challenging.
- Resource Shortages: Companies may approve projects without considering capacity planning or resource availability, especially in competitive bidding environments, resulting in a lack of qualified resources.
- Unclear Start Dates: Projects are often approved without clear start dates, leading to high-level schedules that do not account for resource availability or qualifications.
- Business Disruptions: Projects must be executed without disrupting ongoing business or other projects, which can lead to resource conflicts, especially in low-priority projects.
- Organizational Structure: Matrix structures can create conflicts as line managers struggle to staff multiple projects simultaneously, potentially delaying resource availability for new projects.

Understanding these common causes helps project managers anticipate and plan for conflicts. Effective project managers recognize that conflicts will occur and proactively develop strategies to address them, ensuring smoother project execution and better outcomes.

### 7.2 Types of Conflicts 

Conflicts in projects are inevitable and can arise from various sources, including staffing resources, equipment, costs, technical opinions, priorities, administrative procedures, scheduling, responsibilities, and personality clashes. The intensity of these conflicts can vary throughout the project life cycle, often influenced by factors such as proximity to project constraints, the number of constraints, and the individuals involved.

Scheduling conflicts are the most frequent, but personality clashes can be the most damaging. However, some conflicts, termed "meaningful conflicts," can be beneficial if they lead to productive outcomes without violating project constraints. For example, technical specialists debating solutions can drive innovation and better results.

Effective conflict resolution requires planning and strategy. Project managers should anticipate conflicts and may need to concede on minor issues to prepare for more significant conflicts later. Establishing clear priorities can help resolve conflicts, but these priorities must be stable to be effective. Factors influencing priority setting include technical risks, financial risks, delivery urgency, penalties for delays, expected profits, customer influence, and impacts on other projects or organizations.

Ultimately, top-level management is responsible for setting priorities, but conflicts will still occur. Project managers must be prepared to address these conflicts proactively to ensure project success.

### 7.3 Conflict Resolution 

Conflict resolution in project management can be approached through several methods, each with its own advantages and challenges. The four most common methods are:

**Company-Wide Policies and Procedures:** Some companies develop universal conflict resolution policies. However, this approach often fails because each project and conflict is unique, and project managers prefer to resolve conflicts based on their individual styles and authority levels.

**Project-Specific Conflict Resolution Planning:** Effective conflict resolution can be planned during the early stages of a project. Using tools like linear responsibility charts, project managers can establish their own policies and procedures tailored to the specific needs of the project.

**Hierarchical Referral:** This method involves referring conflicts to a common superior for resolution. While it aims to balance the interests of project and functional managers, it is often impractical as it can overburden higher-level managers and suggest that lower-level managers cannot resolve their own issues.

**Direct Contact:** This approach requires conflicting parties to meet face-to-face to resolve disagreements. While it can be effective, it may not always work and can lead to suppressed issues or new conflicts if overused.

Effective conflict resolution also relies on constant communication of project objectives to team members. Regular reinforcement of these objectives can help prevent misunderstandings and keep the team aligned, reducing the likelihood of conflicts arising in the first place.

### 7.4 The Management of Conflicts 

Effective project managers understand that conflicts are inevitable but can be managed through structured procedures and techniques. When a conflict arises, the project manager should first study the problem by gathering all relevant information, then develop a situational approach tailored to the specific conflict, and finally set an appropriate atmosphere conducive to resolution. If a confrontation meeting is necessary, the project manager should follow a logical sequence of steps to ensure effective conflict resolution. This includes setting a positive climate to encourage participation, analyzing how each party perceives themselves and others, collecting and sharing information openly, defining the problem clearly, and setting priorities through collaborative working sessions. The project manager should also organize cross-functional problem-solving groups, secure commitments, develop an action plan, implement the agreed-upon solutions, and follow up to gather feedback on the effectiveness of the resolution.

To minimize conflicts, project managers should adopt strategies such as pausing and thinking before reacting, building trust among team members, understanding the motives behind the conflict, and maintaining control during meetings. Effective conflict resolution also involves listening to all parties, maintaining a give-and-take attitude, tactfully educating others on your views, admitting when you are wrong, and avoiding dominating discussions. An effective manager in conflict resolution situations knows the organization well, listens with understanding rather than judgment, clarifies the nature of the conflict, and understands the feelings of others. They suggest procedures for resolving differences, maintain relationships with disputing parties, facilitate the communication process, and seek resolutions that are acceptable to all involved.

By following these steps and strategies, project managers can effectively manage and resolve conflicts, ensuring the project stays on track and team dynamics remain positive. This approach not only addresses the immediate conflict but also helps build a collaborative and trusting team environment, which is essential for long-term project success.

### 7.5 Conflict Resolution Modes 

In managing conflicts, project managers must choose an appropriate resolution mode based on the situation, the type of conflict, and the parties involved. The primary conflict resolution modes include confronting (or collaborating), compromising, smoothing (or accommodating), forcing (or competing), and avoiding (or withdrawing). Each mode has specific applications and should be used strategically to achieve the best outcome.

**Confronting (Collaborating):** This approach involves face-to-face meetings where conflicting parties work together to resolve disagreements. It focuses on problem-solving rather than confrontation and is ideal when both parties can achieve their goals, reduce costs, or attack a common foe. Collaboration is effective when there is trust, complementary skills, and sufficient time, and when the objective is to learn from the conflict.

**Compromising:** Compromise involves bargaining to find a solution where both parties gain some satisfaction. It is often seen as a "win-win" or "lose-lose" approach, depending on the outcome. Compromise is useful when both parties need to win, when time is limited, or when maintaining a relationship is important. It is also appropriate when stakes are moderate, and avoiding conflict is preferable.

**Smoothing (Accommodating):** Smoothing aims to reduce emotional tension by emphasizing areas of agreement and downplaying disagreements. While it may not fully resolve the conflict, it encourages parties to remain engaged in the resolution process. Smoothing is suitable for maintaining harmony, creating goodwill, or gaining time, especially when stakes are low or when any solution is acceptable.

**Forcing (Competing):** Forcing occurs when one party imposes a solution on the other, often resulting in a "win-lose" outcome. This approach is used when quick decisions are needed, stakes are high, or important principles are at stake. It is effective in short-term situations or when the relationship between parties is not a priority.

**Avoiding (Withdrawing):** Avoidance is a temporary solution where the conflict is ignored or postponed. It is often viewed as a passive approach but can be strategic when the stakes are low, when more time is needed, or when the problem might resolve itself. Avoidance is also used to unnerve opponents or maintain neutrality.

Each conflict resolution mode has its place in project management, and the choice of mode depends on the specific circumstances and desired outcomes. Effective project managers understand these modes and apply them appropriately to manage conflicts and maintain project progress.

### 7.6 Understanding Superior, Subordinate, and Functional Conflicts 

For a project manager to be effective, they must adeptly navigate interactions with various employee groups, including upper-level management, subordinate project team members, and functional personnel. This requires continuous adaptability, as the working environment and conflict dynamics can vary significantly across these groups. The intensity and type of conflicts often change throughout the project life cycle and depend on the specific employee group involved, as illustrated in Figure 7–1.

The choice of conflict resolution mode is influenced by the individual or group involved in the conflict, as shown in Figure 7–2. While project managers may have preferred resolution modes, the effectiveness of a mode depends on its ability to reduce conflict intensity. For example, withdrawal, though generally less favored, can be effective with functional managers. When dealing with superiors, project managers often prefer compromise over confrontation to avoid escalating conflicts.

Figure 7–3 highlights the influence styles that project managers find effective in mitigating conflicts. Penalty power, authority, and expertise are associated with higher conflict intensity and are generally unfavorable. In contrast, work challenge and promotions (where the project manager has authority) are strongly favorable and help reduce conflicts. These influence styles can create a positive working environment and foster collaboration.

In summary, effective project managers tailor their conflict resolution approaches and influence styles based on the specific employee group and the context of the conflict. By understanding the varying dynamics and employing appropriate strategies, project managers can reduce conflict intensity and maintain a productive project environment.
