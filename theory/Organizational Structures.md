### 3.0 Introduction 

**Overview:**
Over the past 50 years, management has realized that organizations must be dynamic and able to restructure quickly in response to external factors such as market competition and technological changes. Organizational change often arises from internal issues like underutilization of talent or a lack of cooperation. Change involves adjustments to both technical systems (technology and machinery) and social systems (people and group behavior), requiring a balance between the two.

**Challenges of Organizational Restructuring:**
Organizational restructuring often leads to conflicts, especially when altering roles, spans of control, or decision-making structures. The goal is to find a compromise between classical management principles and behavioral theories, addressing both individual and organizational needs. The structure must be adapted to the specific needs of the company, and selecting the right organizational form depends on the judgment of management.

### 3.1 Organizational Work Flow 

Organizations are constantly restructured to adapt to environmental demands, and such restructuring can affect both formal and informal roles within the organization. Behaviorists play a key role in helping the informal organization adapt to changes and resolve conflicts, though their effectiveness depends on their involvement in the formal organization as well. Regardless of the chosen organizational structure, formal channels must be established to ensure each individual has a clear understanding of their authority, responsibility, and accountability.

**Definitions:**

- Authority: The power granted to individuals, often through their position, allowing them to make final decisions.
- Responsibility: The obligation individuals have to perform their assigned tasks effectively within the formal organization.
- Accountability: Being answerable for the completion of specific tasks. (Accountability = authority + responsibility)

While authority and responsibility can be delegated to lower levels, accountability generally remains with the individual. However, many executives resist delegation, believing accountability can exist solely through responsibility. Establishing good relationships between project and functional managers is often challenging, especially when transitioning from a traditional to a project-based organizational structure. Trust is essential for success in this process.
